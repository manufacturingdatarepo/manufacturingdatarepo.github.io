Although there are large repositories of open datasets (eg Kaggle, Google’s Dataset Search, DataQuest) these lack examples of production data suitable for teach data carpentry and machine learning skills. This project  facilitated the creation of GDPR complaint datasets and exemplar notebooks from the student’s work to create a unique resource of industrial data suitable for teaching and research. The vision is to create a repository with a focus on data relevant to industrial processes.


Aims & Objectives 
======

One issue with current paradigms is that there are limited resources on manufacturing data that are tailored for learning. Moreover, most manufacturing labelled data are datasets with financial data instead of manufacturing process data. Another issues is that current datasets are not as usable since they have millions of datapoints that are hard to process and work with when learning data science. 

With this project we aim to:

•	Improve the ease of use by creating small, manageable datasets that can be used along with computational thinking in project-based learning for engineers
•	Contribute to open resources as these datasets will be public and could be the basis for a new lesson in the future

The target audience:
•	university students, 
•	industrial employees looking to upskill or reskill
•	whoever wants to learn data science in a manufacturing context
