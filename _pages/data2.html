    <h1>Company Name: CollaGrow</h1>

    <p>Company Description: CollaGrow is a leading biotechnology company specializing in the production of innovative collagen-based products for cell culture applications. With a mission to provide researchers and scientists with advanced tools for cell growth and tissue engineering, CollaGrow focuses on developing collagen petri dishes that offer a superior environment for cultivating cells in a controlled manner.</p>

    <h2>Product: CollagenPetri™ Dishes</h2>

    <p>CollagenPetri™ Dishes are CollaGrow's flagship product line, designed to revolutionize cell culture and create optimal conditions for cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. These petri dishes are made from high-quality collagen derived from carefully sourced and purified animal tissues, ensuring exceptional biocompatibility and support for various cell types.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <p>We have approximately 200 different recipes of collagen that we manufacture. Our manufacturing process consists of cooking up the collagen in a pressure vessel and then pouring it into petri dishes on one of 4 production lines in a cleanroom. Our current scrap costs and failure rates on production batches are higher than we’d like. We want to look at the available data to assess where our current issues are and to see if more in-depth analysis can find equipment or products to look at that currently aren’t being investigated. We only do an RCA if there is more than 40% scrap on a batch and tend to focus only on our top 6 products. The data covers our plates and bottles departments, but I will solely focus on plates as that is where our issues lie.</p>
