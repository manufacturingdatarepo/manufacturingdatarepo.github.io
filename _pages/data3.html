    <h2>Data:</h2>

    <p>Plate profilers are used in the automotive and transportation industries for cutting metal plates used in vehicle chassis, frames, and body parts.</p>

    <p>The ESAB is responsible for reported steel cuts; to that end, we must understand machine capacity, utilization, uptime, downtime, and bottlenecks. With a particular focus on driving Nesting efficiencies, where and how can we improve nesting NC programs?</p>

    <p>We have four weeksâ€™ worth of .csv files from the ESAB machine to investigate.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement: "Optimizing Nesting NC Programs in Automotive Plate Profilers"</h2>

    <p>In the automotive and transportation industries, plate profilers are essential for cutting metal plates used in various vehicle components such as chassis, frames, and body parts. ESAB, a manufacturer of plate profilers, is responsible for ensuring efficient steel-cutting operations. To achieve this, they need to analyze the machine's capacity, utilization, uptime, and downtime and identify bottlenecks in the production process. Their specific focus is on improving nesting NC programs to enhance the efficiency of plate-cutting operations.</p>

    <p>Given the availability of four weeks' worth of .csv files from the ESAB machine, the data science problem is to analyze this data and propose improvements to the nesting NC programs for plate profilers. The objective is to optimize the cutting process to reduce material waste, increase machine utilization, and minimize downtime.</p>

    <p>The goal of this data science project is to help ESAB make data-driven decisions to improve the nesting NC programs for their plate profilers, ultimately reducing costs and enhancing the quality of their products in the automotive and transportation industries.</p>
