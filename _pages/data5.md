    <h1>Company Name: ForgeOptics Solutions, Inc.</h1>

  <p><strong>Company Description:</strong> ForgeOptics Solutions, Inc. is a cutting-edge technology company optimizing the radial forging manufacturing process across various industrial sectors. Leveraging data science, advanced analytics, and state-of-the-art technologies, ForgeOptics Solutions aims to revolutionize the production of high-quality components through data-driven insights and innovative solutions.</p>

  <h2>Data Overview:</h2>

  <p>Radial forging is a widely adopted manufacturing process with numerous advantages, such as high productivity, exceptional material properties, and enhanced dimensional accuracy. Our company primarily uses data collected from a GFM SKK10/R radial forge located at the Advanced Forming Research Centre (AFRC) of the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. Our dataset contains measurements of 16 critical dimensions for each of the 81 parts forged during a single day of operation. These measurements are obtained using a state-of-the-art Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM).</p>

  <h2>Our Mission:</h2>

  <p>At ForgeInsight Solutions, we aim to harness the power of data science and advanced analytics to revolutionize the radial forging industry. We aim to establish correlations between machining parameters, represented by sensor values, and part quality. By doing so, we help manufacturers identify the critical parameters that impact product quality most. Our data-driven insights empower you to make informed decisions that drive process improvement and quality enhancement.</p>

  <h2>Processing Parameters Recorded by Sensors:</h2>

  <p>Our in-depth analysis encompasses the entire radial forging process, from the initial heating and transfer phases to the forging process. We record data from 99 sensors, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the manufacturing cycle. Notably, our approach enables us to create internal features on hollow parts by using a mandrel, a unique capability of radial forging.</p>

  <h2>Dimensional Data Recorded by the CMM Machine:</h2>

  <p>The CMM machine records the 16 critical dimensions of the parts after processing. We compare these measurements with the nominal dimensions, positive tolerances, and negative tolerances of each dimension to assess product quality accurately.</p>

  <h2>Problem Description: Optimizing Quality in Radial Forging Processes</h2>

  <p>The challenge is to enhance the quality of products produced through radial forging processes. We aim to leverage data science techniques to analyze and understand the relationships between processing parameters and product quality. By doing so, we seek to identify critical process variables and potential improvements to drive quality optimization in radial forging.</p>

  <p>This problem statement outlines the need to address the quality variability in radial forging and the role of data science in providing insights and solutions to ensure a consistent and high-quality manufacturing process.</p>
